### Hi there! 😁

My name is Mattheus Nunes from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been a computer engineer since 2017 and currently I'm Professor at [SuperGeeks Cuiabá](https://supergeeks.com.br).

In my free time I like to play (and watch) soccer (⚽️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and finally I like to practice capoeira. 

Would you like to find me?
